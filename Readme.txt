This code was updated in july 2018 to update the code to use Qt 5.11 and MSVC 2015 and MSVC 2017 compilers.
The code should compile with Qt 5.11.1 MSVC2015 64 bit, Qt 5.11.1 MSVC2017 64 bit and Qt 5.11.1 MinGW 32bit

To get the development environment ready. Download and install Qt 5.11. Then install visual studio 2015 and visual studio 2017. (MinGW compiler should come with the QT distribution).
