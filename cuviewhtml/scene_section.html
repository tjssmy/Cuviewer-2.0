Scene Item Properties</h3>

<p>Each different Scene Item follows the following pattern for
arrangement:</p>

<p>unsigned char = object properties<br>
float [3] = vertex position<br>
. . .<br>
float [&lt;3 | 4&gt;] = color of vertex or shape (may not be
needed)<br>
. . .<br>
float [3] = normalized normal vector<br>
. . .</p>

<p>All Scene Items share a common-format description byte. It is
an <b>unsigned char</b> that describes what object properties to
expect. The property byte is composed by <b>or</b>ing the
following:</p>

<h4><a name="common_scene_item_properties_filled"></a>Filled (SFILL
tag)</h4>

<p>Indicates that the object should be filled. *</p>

<h4><a name="common_scene_item_properties_outlined"></a>Outlined
(SOUTLINE tag)</h4>

<p>Indicates that the object should be outlined. *</p>

<h4><a name="common_scene_item_properties_multicolor"></a>Multicolor
(SMULTICOLOR tag)</h4>

<p>Indicates that each vertex should be a different color, e.g.,
a triangle would have three sets of colors instead of one in the
file. It is not possible to only specify colors for some of the
vertices--all must be specified.</p>

<h4><a name="common_scene_item_properties_transparent"></a>Transparent
(STRANSPARENT tag)</h4>

<p>Indicates that all defined colors will have an alpha channel,
i.e., the RGBA color model is to be used instead of the RGB color
model. This results in a float [4] being written for each color.</p>

<h4><a name="common_scene_item_properties_normals"></a>Normals (SNORMALS
tag)</h4>

<p>Indicates that normals are specified. Normally, normals are
implicitly defined as being a vector orthogonal to the plane
defined by the first three points of a closed shape; however,
this allows for non-orthogonal normals to create smoother-looking
scenes. <b>Important</b>: if normals are to be defined, make sure
they are normalized, i.e., they are unit length. Also, normals
must point away from the surface being lit, e.g., a sphere made
from triangles would have all normal vectors pointing <i>away</i>
from the center.</p>

<p>When defining closed shapes (triangles and quadrilaterals),
corners must be defined in a counterclockwise fashion to the
front. If normals are specified, then they must agree with the
direction of the corners of the shape. For example, in a sphere
made of triangles, looking at it from the outside, all visible
triangles must be defined counterclockwise and all normals must
be pointing towards the camera.</p>

<p>* the Filled and Outlined Properties can be used together to
get interesting results. If neither is specified, then the shape
is sent to the outline list, and no colors are needed in the file.
If both are specified, then the shape is outlined (sent to the
outline list), and it is also filled.</p>

<p>Since each shape is different, not all properties can be set
the same, e.g., a point cannot be filled, multicolor, or have a
normal. See each shape for more details.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="scene_section_items"></a>Scene
Section Items</h3>

<h4><a name="scene_section_items_point_item"></a>Point Item (SPOINT
tag)</h4>

<p>This item draws a point. Points cannot be filled, they are
always outlined, they cannot be multicolor, they can be
transparent, and they cannot have normals.</p>

<p>Format:</p>

<p>unsigned char = common scene item properties<br>
float [3] = vector 1<br>
float [&lt;3 | 4&gt;] = color (may be using RGB or RGBA depending
on properties)</p>

<h4><a name="scene_section_items_line_item"></a>Line Item (SLINE
tag)</h4>

<p>This item draws a line. Lines cannot be filled, they are
always outlined, they can be multicolor, they can be transparent,
and they cannot have normals.</p>

<p>Format:</p>

<p>unsigned char = common scene item properties<br>
float [3] = vector 1<br>
float [3] = vector 2<br>
float [&lt;3 | 4&gt;] = color (may be using RGB or RGBA depending
on properties)<br>
(. . .) (if multicolor)</p>

<h4><a name="scene_section_items_triangle_item"></a>Triangle Item
(STRIA tag)</h4>

<p>This item draws a triangle. Triangles can be filled, they can
be outlined, they can be multicolor, they can be transparent, and
they can have normals.</p>

<p>Format:</p>

<p>unsigned char = common scene item properties<br>
float [3] = vector 1<br>
float [3] = vector 2<br>
float [3] = vector 3<br>
float [&lt;3 | 4&gt;] = color (may be using RGB or RGBA depending
on properties)<br>
(. . .<br>
&nbsp;. . .) (if multicolor)<br>
(float [3][3] = normals) (if normals are selected)</p>

<h4><a name="scene_section_items_quadrilateral_item"></a>Quadrilateral
Item (SQUADRI tag)</h4>

<p>This item draws a quadrilateral. Quadrilaterals can be filled,
they can be outlined, they can be multicolor, they can be
transparent, and they can have normals. <b>Important</b>: the
quadrilateral corners must be coplanar when defined in order to
render properly--if a non-flat quadrilateral is wanted, then two
triangles should be used.</p>

<p>Format:</p>

<p>unsigned char = common scene item properties<br>
float [3] = vector 1<br>
float [3] = vector 2<br>
float [3] = vector 3<br>
float [3] = vector 4<br>
float [&lt;3 | 4&gt;] = color (may be using RGB or RGBA depending
on properties)<br>
(. . .<br>
&nbsp;. . .<br>
&nbsp;. . .) (if multicolor)<br>
(float [3][4] = normals) (if normals are selected)</p>

<h4><a name="scene_section_items_sphere_item"></a>Sphere Item (SSPHERE
tag)</h4>

<p>This item draws a sphere. Spheres can be filled, they can be
outlined, they cannot be multicolor, they can be transparent, and
they cannot have normals defined (normals are automatically
created for a filled sphere).</p>

<p>Format:</p>

<p>unsigned char = common scene item properties<br>
float [3] = vector 1 (the position of the center of the sphere)<br>
float = radius<br>
float [&lt;3 | 4&gt;] = color (may be using RGB or RGBA depending
on properties)</p>

<h4><a name="scene_section_items_spheroid_item"></a>Spheroid Item
(SSPHOID tag)</h4>

<p>This item draws a spheroid. Spheroids can be filled, they can
be outlined, they cannot be multicolor, they can be transparent,
and they cannot have normals defined (normals are automatically
created for a filled spheroid).</p>

<p>Format:</p>

<p>unsigned char = common scene item properties<br>
float [3] = vector 1 (the position of the center of the spheroid)
<br>
float [3] = size (the (x, y, z) dimensions before rotation)<br>
float [4] = rotation (specified by (theta, x, y, z), where theta
is the counterclockwise angle in degrees, which is to rotate
about the vector (x, y, z). No rotation will occur if a zero
angle or a null vector is passed)<br>
float [&lt;3 | 4&gt;] = color (may be using RGB or RGBA depending
on properties)</p>
